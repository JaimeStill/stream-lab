## Notes

* [Choose an algorithm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/cryptography-model#choose-an-algorithm) - describes the recommended algorithms available by application (i.e. - data privacy, data integrity, key exchange, etc.).

* [Cross-platform cryptography](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/cross-platform-cryptography) - describes cryptography standards and availability per platform.

* [Hybrid Cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem) - Encrypt data with a symmetric algorithm, then encrypt the symmetric key with an asymmetric algorithm.
